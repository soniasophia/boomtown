# Boomtown
## Project Summary
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run the project, npm install and run "npm run dev".

Create the front-end UI of a web-based application to support a local sharing economy. Functionally, the app will allow users to browse all items and user profiles by the end of the first half of the project, and ultimately also share items of their own and request to borrow items from other users during the second half.

Your project must use local mock data, React and the Material UI library to build out the application's UI, Redux and react-redux to manage application state, and React Router for routing.

Continue working on your Boomtown by adding the server-side components. Once completed, your project should have a functioning user login (with protected routes) and allow users to share new items.

Your project must include a server (Node/Express/GraphQL), a connected database (PostgreSQL), a connected client (React), and form with submit and data validation (Redux-Form), and user authentication (Firebase).

## Personal Learnings
- Learned about building an app with both client-side and server-side code and best practices when making decisions about what logic to handle on client-side versus server-side.
- Learned about higher order components, components, storing initial states, props, dispatching actions and reducers.
- Learned how to write resolver functions, data schemas and make queries for data and using GraphiQL to test queries.
- Learned how to authenticate a user using Firebase tokens.
- Learned how to protect routes when user is not in an authenticated state.
